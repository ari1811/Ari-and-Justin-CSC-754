                <p>This study aims to analyze the spread of three common viruses—Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and Norovirus—within public transportation systems by simulating transmission dynamics. 
                    Through modeling various factors such as passenger density, ventilation, and mitigation strategies, this research seeks to identify effective interventions to minimize 
                    virus spread and enhance public health responses.

            <div class="thesis-paragraph">
                <p>Public transportation plays a critical role in urban mobility, yet it also serves as a significant vector for the spread of infectious diseases. Enclosed spaces, high passenger 
                    turnover, and shared surfaces create an environment where viruses can rapidly transmit, posing serious public health concerns. This study focuses on three common viruses—Influenza, 
                    SARS-CoV-2, and Norovirus—to understand their transmission dynamics within buses, trains, and subways. By utilizing simulation-based approaches, this research examines how different 
                    factors, including ventilation systems, passenger density, and intervention strategies, influence viral spread. The goal is to provide data-driven insights into effective mitigation 
                    measures, such as improved air filtration, disinfection protocols, and policy recommendations, to reduce the risk of viral outbreaks in public transit systems.
